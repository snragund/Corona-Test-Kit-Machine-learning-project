# Corona Test Kit Machine learning project

We have created a website to resolve the confusion between Covid-19 and Flu. The purpose is to predict if a person is infected by Flu or not, and to determine the chances of having Corona based on various factors such as symptoms exhibited by the patients.

!! In view of the model, we will have the capacity to decide the elements that most likely lead to correctly determine the FLU status. It help us to analyse the symptoms related to the FLU status.

!! Our model can help hospitals to have an idea of how much they need to stock up on medication.

!! For the infected, there are not enough resources available in most of the countries. Our aim is to get the needy patients the proper treatment at the right time. This is also done to improve the screening process, so that hospitals don't have to carry the burden of patients who aren't in a critical stage.

!! This project is for edcational purpose.

!! Front and back end developement of website using Html and Machine learnig model.
